#### Title: Using github.com/ORG/REPO

I would like to use github.com/ORG/REPO as a dependency in the XYZ project. This issue will serve as a tracking issue for verification of this project:

## Project Health Check

- [ ] The license is acceptable per our [license policy](docs/license-policy.md)
- [ ] The repository is well maintained
   - Security vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner
   - Project shows regular activity
   - Bugs reported in issues are addressed promptly

- [ ] Is the canonical source of truth for the steps to be taken before open sourcing a project
- [ ] Contains appropriate links to enable project maintainers to complete the process with minimal support
- [ ] Includes appropriate information on the teams or individuals to mention at each stage of the process
- [ ] Demands 100% compliance. All of the boxes should be checked or an issue comment added about why a specific step isn't necessary BEFORE a project is released as open source.

## Internal Process

- [ ] Notify the xyz team that you intend to use this project

- [ ] Directly on this branch, update the placeholder text in the ISSUE_TEMPLATE as appropriate for your organization.
- [ ] Add links to documents that are external to this repository, like an employee IP agreement.
- [ ] Add steps you will require maintainers to complete.
- [ ] Remove steps you will not require maintainers to complete.
